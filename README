1. Overview
The Zero Velocity Release is the first increment of the project. It's purpose is to implement
any infrastructure required by the project to test and deploy the product, without actually delivering any real functionality.

2. Features: 
The features of the Zero Velocity Release are to capture PML code in a text area, submit
the code to the backend, and display the output from the pmlcheck analysis tool when run 
with the code as input.
Source code for pmlcheck is taken from the GitHub pml/check directory.

3. Setup
These instructions are for installing this software on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.

Ensure the target system is up to date by running the following commands as root:
	apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

Install the following packages from the Ubuntu repository by running the following command as root:
	apt-get install <packagename>

	apache2
	php5
	php5-sqlite
	
This software can coexist with other services running on the server. Each instance of the IDE must
be given a project name (referred to as projectName) This name must be supplied as the first
argument to each of the maintenance scrips.

Now the required system dependencies are installed. Next, run the "install.sh projectName" script as
root to copy the required files to Apache's working directory. Run
"verify_installation.sh projectName" to verify that the files were installed correctly.

The software should now be deployed on the system. Accessing "localhost/projectName" in a browser
should display the IDE.

The "clean.sh projectName" script will delete the project folder.
