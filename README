1. Overview
The Zero Velocity Release is the first increment of the project. It's purpose is to implement
any infrastructure required by the project to test and deploy the product, without actually delivering any real functionality.

2. Features: 
The features of the Zero Velocity Release are to capture PML code in a text area, submit
the code to the backend, and display the output from the pmlcheck analysis tool when run 
with the code as input.
Source code for pmlcheck is taken from the GitHub pml/check directory.

3. Setup
These instructions are for installing this software on Ubuntu 14.04.

Ensure the target system is up to date by running the following commands as root:
	apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

Install the following packages from the Ubuntu repository by running the following command as root:
	apt-get install <packagename>

	apache2
	mysql-server
	libapache2-mod-auth-mysql
	php5
	php5-mysql
	
During installation, MySQL will prompt for a password. Note this password.

Setup MySQL by running the following commands as root:
	mysql_install_db
	/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
	
The mysql_secure_installation program will prompt for the MySQL password.

Now the requires system dependencies are installed. Next, run the "install.sh" script as root to copy
the required files to Apache's working directory.

The software should now be deployed on the system. Accessing "localhost" in a browser should display the IDE.
